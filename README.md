This repo gives a runner for C# console applications. It can be used in end-to-end tests for C# console applications, where the application runner can be passed input data for the application and the runner then returns the program output. This is done by running the console application in a process and redirecting standard input and standard output. The program input should be passed as the list of strings, in order to represent the console application being supplied multiple lines of input. This runner therefore allows true end-to-end testing of a C# console application within a test suite.

The console application runner needs to be instantiated with the class name of the console application program, i.e. the class containing the Main() method for the console application, and a string for the name of the console application executable file.
