This repo gives a runner for C# console applications. It can be used in end-to-end tests for C# console applications, where the program can be passed input data and the runner then returns the program output. This is done by running the console application in a process and redirecting standard input and standard output. This runner therefore allows true end-to-end testing of a C# console application within a test suite.

The console application runner needs to be instantiated with the class name of the console application program, i.e. the class containing the Main() method for the console application, and a string for the name of the console application executable file.
